# Traveling-Salesman-Problem TSP -using-Simulated-Annealing

In this, project, we will using the simulated annealing algorithm ,a metaheuristic model, to solve the probelm of traveling-Salesman. This algorithm has great performance in avoiding local minima. 

The problem is given a list of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city?
Simulated Annealing, inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy, offers a heuristic approach to tackling this problem by simulating the physical process of cooling a material. This algorithm gradually explores the solution space, allowing for occasional uphill moves (accepting worse solutions) to escape local optima and eventually converge towards an optimal or near-optimal solution.

In this project, we used the python programming language to implement a solution for TSP problem using Simukated Annealing.
